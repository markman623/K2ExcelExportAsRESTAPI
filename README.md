# K2ExcelExportAsRESTAPI
Specify an SMO that is exposed as an oData endpoint, return an Excel file.  This is just for sample purposes as there are probably better ways to do this.

So far only tested with:
1. Basic Auth to K2 oData services
2. IIS Express on a local dev machine, with a local host url
3. No login to the REST broker
